# Falling Leaves Simulation

This animation was for a course project. It took me 2 nights but I learned some OpenGL and graphics. You can simply run ```make``` on main directory and run the generated ```tree``` binary.

On Debian systems, required libraries can be installed by
```
sudo apt install libglew-dev freeglut3-dev
```
